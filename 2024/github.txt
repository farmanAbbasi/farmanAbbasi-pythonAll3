If GitHub is not accepting your username and password when trying to push changes, it's likely due to the fact that GitHub has deprecated the use of username and password for authentication in favor of personal access tokens or SSH keys. Here's what you can do to resolve this:
**Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   a. Log in to your GitHub account.
   b. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner, then go to "Settings."
   c. In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings," and then "Personal access tokens."
   d. Click on the "Generate new token" button.
   e. Give your token a name, select the scopes/permissions you need (usually "repo" for full access), and then click "Generate token."
   f. Copy the generated token (make sure to save it somewhere secure, as you won't be able to see it again).
2. Use the Personal Access Token for Pushing:
   a. When you are prompted for a username and password during a push, use your GitHub username as the username and paste the Personal Access Token as the password.
   b. If you're using Git on the command line, you can also set up the token using:
      ```bash
      git config --global credential.helper store
      ```
   This will store your credentials (including the token) securely so that you don't have to enter them every time.
**Option 2: Use SSH Keys**
1. Set Up an SSH Key:
   a. If you haven't already, generate an SSH key pair on your local machine:
      ```bash
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
      ```
   b. Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:
      ```bash
      eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
      ```
2. Add Your Public Key to GitHub:
   a. Copy the contents of your public key file (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`).
   b. Go to your GitHub account settings, click on "SSH and GPG keys," and add a new SSH key with the copied public key.
3. Push Using SSH:
   After setting up your SSH key, you can push changes to GitHub repositories without needing to enter a username or password.
Choose the option that works best for you, either using a Personal Access Token or SSH keys. Both options are more secure than using a traditional username and password for authentication.


Use the username as username and password as the token u just created and then the push command will work.

How to change the username and password:
git credential-cache exit
