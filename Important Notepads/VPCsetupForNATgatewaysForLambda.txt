NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet.

1)create subnets:
one public subnet two private subnets

2)goto routetables
create two 
attach one with public subnet and one with both private subnets 



3)create a new internet gateway and attach to VPC
4)goto rt and add the internet gateway on public subnet-rt with destination 0.0.0.0/0

5)now goto NAT gateways and select public subnet with elastic ip
6) go back to rt and add the private-subnet-rt to target the NAT gateway ith 0.0.0.0/0
7)at this point we have two route tables
one public-subnet-rt pointing to internet gateway
one priavte-subnet-rt pointing to NAT gateway

//private lambda subnet
subnet-966556ec : private-lambda-1
subnet-b1bb20fd :private-lambda-2

//public lambda subnet:	
subnet-fa5da791 :public-redshift-lambda-subnet

//route tables:
public subnet rt





//on roles add
AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
private subnet rt for our vpc



//note : On the lambda:

For Subnets, select the private subnets that you created.
